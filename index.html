        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Sarah Yae and I am a 20 year old Korean American who grew up in Irvine, California. My family immigrated to the states when I was around 7 years old and I have attended great schools in California from the third grade including Canyon View Elementary School, Sierra Vista Middle School, and Northwood High School all located in the beautiful city of Irvine, California. I am currently attending the University of Riverside, California pursuing a major in business economics.<br><br>

        During my last two years at the University of California, Riverside, I have taken a lot of different courses to figure out what I am passionate about, as well as have an interest and talent at. I have taken history classes, numerous English classes, religion classes, computer science classes, and even psychology classes to see if any subjects would catch my eye. Currently, I am interested in computer science, history, and philosophy and plan to take more courses regarding these subjects in my next years in the university.<br><br>

        My name is Sarah Seungyeon Yae and I am a 19 year old Northwood High School graduate attending the University of California, Riverside studying administrative studies. I am passionate about dancing, music, volunteering, and writing.

I also volunteered at Culverdale Elementary School with the Emerging Leaders program at America on Track for three years with upper elementary schoolers who have taught me patience and perspective. Additionally, I learned how to play the violin in my school orchestra for 7 years, eventually landing an opportunity to be a member of the Southern California Orchestra. I was also involved in Northwood High School's Marching Band and the Jazz Band for two semesters. I am passionate, proactive, organized, and thrilled for new opportunities to serve my community! am passionate about dancing, volunteering, spending time with my family, and writing.
